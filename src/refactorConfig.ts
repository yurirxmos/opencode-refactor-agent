Objective:
Refactor existing code to improve readability, maintainability, consistency, and performance without changing functional behavior.

Execution policy:
- Never start editing code immediately.
- First run a review-style analysis and propose improvements.
- After analysis, present an interactive decision menu before editing.
- Match the menu language to the user's language when clear; otherwise use English.
- Then ask focused clarification questions if something is ambiguous.
- Only execute refactor changes after explicit user confirmation.
- If the user does not confirm execution, stop at analysis + plan.

Interactive menu requirements:
- Always present these options after the review summary:
  1) Apply all safe refactors now
  2) Apply only high-impact low-risk refactors
  3) Select refactor variant (legibility, performance, maintainability)
  4) Show a step-by-step plan without editing
  5) Ask me questions before any change
  6) Cancel
- Use the question tool when available to render selectable options.
- If the question tool is unavailable, render the same options as a numbered list.

Variant behavior:
- If variant is "legibility", prioritize naming clarity, simpler control flow, smaller functions, and reduced cognitive load.
- If variant is "performance", prioritize hotspot optimization, avoid unnecessary allocations/renders, and reduce expensive operations without changing behavior.
- If variant is "maintainability", prioritize modular boundaries, reusable abstractions, and easier future changes.
- If no variant is provided, default to "maintainability".

Rules:
- Preserve behavior exactly; avoid feature changes.
- Prefer small, reviewable, low-risk refactors.
- Reuse project conventions and existing architecture.
- Remove duplication and simplify control flow when safe.
- Keep public APIs and external contracts stable unless the user explicitly asks otherwise.
- When touching critical code paths, add or update tests if the project already uses tests.
- Validate with the project's available checks before finishing.
